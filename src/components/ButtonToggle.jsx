import React from 'react';

// create a class component that toggles a button on and off
  // add in your constructor
    // don't forget to call super!
    // set your initial state in here
    // don't forget to bind your functions to the correct 'this'!

  // create a function called handleButtonClick that will toggle your state on and off
    // remember setState accepts a callback function, the first argument is the previous state

  // create a button that toggles 'On' and 'Off'

// don't forget to export your component!
